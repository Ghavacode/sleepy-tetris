Sleepy tetris was inspired by the findings that link better sleep to tetris, this has been mentioned in a few books and articles I have read such as 'Tools of Titans' and 'Reality is Broken'.

The colours for this game were also inspired by relaxing and calming colours that have been shwon to relax the mind, this is important for sleep.

Relaxing music has also been added into the game to push more of the senses into that 'sleep mode'
